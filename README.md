# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors

**Foundations Course Project**

## 📖 Introduction

This project is part of the _Foundations Course_. It involves creating the **Rock Paper Scissors** game using JavaScript.
The game is played entirely in the **browser console** (no GUI yet).

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Practice basic **JavaScript programming**.
- Apply **problem-solving** and **step-by-step development**.
- Use **functions**, **loops**, and **conditionals**.
- Test and debug using the **console**.

---

## 🏗️ Project Steps

1. **Setup the project structure**

   - Create an HTML file and link an external JavaScript file.
   - Test the connection with `console.log("Hello World")`.

2. **Get the computer’s choice**

   - Write a function `getComputerChoice()` that randomly returns `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.

3. **Get the human’s choice**

   - Write a function `getHumanChoice()` that takes user input using `prompt()`.

4. **Declare score variables**

   - Initialize `humanScore` and `computerScore` to `0`.

5. **Play a single round**

   - Create `playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice)` that compares choices, updates scores, and logs the result.

6. **Play the full game**

   - Create `playGame()` to play 5 rounds, track scores, and declare the final winner.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open your HTML file in a browser.
2. Open the **developer console**.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The game logic runs entirely in the console.
- A GUI version will be added in a later lesson.
